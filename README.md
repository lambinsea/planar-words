A new touchscreen keyboard just released. It appears to be a regular 26-gon, with each vertice sequentially labeled with one letter from the alphabet. To type a word, you may start with its first letter and draw a straight line segment to its second, chaining this process until you reach the final letter of the word. For example, to type "THE," you would draw lines TH and HE. 

However, the keyboard has one (extremely inconvenient) drawback: if any of these line segments intersect, the word will not input. For example, "SCARED," which has intersecting lines SC and AR, is invalid. However, "SACRED," which has no intersecting lines, is valid. 

To make this more complicated, the keyboard WILL input if line segments only intersect at vertices (e.g. "SEATED," "TARTS"). Note that retracing a line segment still counts as an intersection--this said, words such as "STATS" or "SEES" would be invalid.

Now, here are some questions that pertain to this keyboard:
- What is the longest word you can write with this keyboard? What percent of English words can be typed using an alphabetical configuration?
- What is the optimal configuration for this keyboard? Assume our goal is to write the most words possible.
